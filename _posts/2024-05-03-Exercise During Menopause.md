<p>Exercise plays a crucial role in managing the symptoms of menopause. Regular physical activity can help alleviate hot flashes, improve mood, boost energy levels, and promote better sleep. Additionally, exercise can help prevent weight gain and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. By incorporating exercise into your routine during menopause, you can improve your overall quality of life and maintain your physical and mental well-being.</p>

<p>During menopause, women experience a decrease in estrogen levels, which can lead to changes in body composition, including increased fat around the abdomen and a loss of muscle mass. These hormonal changes can also affect metabolism, making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. Understanding these changes is essential when designing an exercise routine during menopause. It is important to focus on strength training to maintain muscle mass, as well as cardiovascular exercise to support weight management and overall health.</p>
